# DarkModePreferencesTutorial
A tutorial app as a guide for implementing Night/Dark Mode using ListPreference in Android.

This tutorial blog teaches how to change the app theme using the `androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatDelegate` class.
It also teaches how to use `ListPreference` from the `androidx.preference` package to create a switch in the in-app settings (activity) to allow the user to choose the setting that she/he prefers.
